## 🔠 Core Phonetic Adjustments

| Native Sound | Phonetic Spelling | Notes |
|--------------|------------------|-------|
| Rue / Rui    | **rwi**           | Works better in Suno for smooth 'r' sounds |
| Thai / Thay  | **theh**          | Avoids sounding like “Thai” |
| Kanak        | **kan nak**       | Two-part split improves rhythm |
| Chup         | **chup**          | Keeps the sucking sound clear |
| Kaduk        | **kaduk**         | "Bite/crunch" sound — keep as is |

## 🧠 Tips

- Always test new words using short verse trials
- Use rhythmic repetition (“pat thoh”, “pat na”) for better melody pickup
- Avoid spelling too close to English words if it changes tone (e.g. “mate” → wrong tone)
