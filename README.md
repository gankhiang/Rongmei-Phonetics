## 🔡 Phonetic Style

To ensure smooth AI pronunciation, we adjust Rongmei words into easier spellings for Suno AI:

| Rongmei Sound | AI Phonetic Used | Why? |
|---------------|------------------|------|
| Rui           | `rwi`            | Softer & natural tone for AI models |
| Thay          | `theh`           | Avoids Thai-sounding misread |
| Kan Nak       | `kan nak`        | Indicates "long time" fluency |
| Chup Pat      | `chup pat`       | Natural syllables for "suck it out" |
